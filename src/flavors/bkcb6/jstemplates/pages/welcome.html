<p>Citizens pay taxes with an expectation that tax dollars will be used to improve facilities and services in their communities. Citizens also have the right to influence how those tax dollars are spent by providing input to their local Community Boards. Public input is necessary to ensure that new needs are identified and requests are justified.</p>
<p>Every year, each Community Board establishes and submits a prioritized list of capital budget requests for physical projects throughout their district. The Mayor, City Council, and Borough President review these requests and consider them when determining the City’s budget.</p>
<p>By using this map, you are participating in the process of identifying and justifying capital budget projects. The Community Board will use the projects identified on this map to help prioritize budget requests.</p>

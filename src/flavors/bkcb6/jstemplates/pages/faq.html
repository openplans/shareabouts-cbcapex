<h4>What is a capital project?</h4>
<p>A capital project is the construction, reconstruction, acquisition, or installation of a physical public improvement with a value equal to or over $35,000, and a “useful life” of at least five years. Capital projects are “brick and mortar” projects—not services.</p> 
<p>If your idea is a neighborhood improvement that costs less than $35,000, such as a new bench or bike rack, you can <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/311/" title="311 | City of New York">find the appropriate agency to file a service request here</a>.</p>

<h4>My capital budget idea covers a large area, where should I place my marker on the map?</h4>

<p>Many capital budget ideas cover multiple locations or even the entire district. </p>

<p>For district wide requests, simply input the request close to a relevant location (for example, if you are requesting Wi-Fi service in all the subway stations, place the icon over one station), fill out the form, and check the “District Wide Request” box. To see other district wide requests click on the District Wide Requests tab.</p>

<h4>My capital budget request doesn’t fit into one of the three categories, what should I do?</h4>

<p>Choose the category that you think fits your idea the best, and if it needs to be changed at a later date an editor will do so. The most important thing is to get your ideas on the map, not to worry if they are categorized correctly.</p>

<h4>I’m really excited about citizen input into budget decisions, how can I get more involved?</h4>
<p>Great! One way is through the Participatory Budgeting, “a democratic process in which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget” (<a href="http://pbnyc.org/" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY. REAL PROJECTS. REAL POWER.">pbnyc.org</a>).</p>
<p>PB projects must be between $35,000- $1 million, and previous local examples include purchasing computers for schools and libraries, the construction of a community compost center, tree plantings, and repairs/ safety enhancements at dangerous intersections.</p>
<p>Several local Councilmembers, including Carlos Menchaca (District 38) and Brad Lander (District 39) have allocated approximately $3 million for community decision making this year. <a href="http://pbnyc.org/" title="Participatory Budgeting in New York City | REAL MONEY.

<h4>The Who, What and How’s of Posting</h4>
<p><strong>To add a budget request, drag the map until the crosshairs are over the location for your desired budget request, then click on the “Identify a Need” box in the lower left corner and fill out the pop-up form.</strong></p>
<p>Suggestions must be for <strong>capital</strong> eligible projects-- the construction, reconstruction, acquisition, or installation of a physical public improvement with a value equal to or over $35,000, and a “useful life” of at least five years. Capital projects are large “brick and mortar” projects—not services or salaries, which are called expenses. For example, building a library is a capital project and would be eligible for the map, while paying the librarian’s salary is an expense and therefore not eligible.</p>

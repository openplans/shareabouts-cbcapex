<h4>What is this map?</h4>
<p>This project will provide an ongoing mechanism for collecting ideas and suggestions from the public on where they believe the City government ought to be spending and investing capital budget dollars. Public input is vital to ensuring that government spending is done in greater alignment with the priorities and values of our communities. Ultimately, this project is intended to be a tool for increasing citizen participation and supporting the democratization of the City’s budget process.</p>

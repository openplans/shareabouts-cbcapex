Thank you so much for using in Community Board Six’s Community Budget Suggestions map! We appreciate your input and involvement in your community’s budget decisions. Your request has been included in our budget suggestions list, and every single suggestion will be reviewed by the Community Board budget committee.

The most frequent and supported requests will be included in our annual budget request to the City, which will be submitted to the Mayor and Borough President in September.

How can you stay involved with the Community Board’s budget process?

1. Check back in on the map regularly to see how people are supporting and commenting on your suggestion (bkcb6budgetmap.org).

2. Search for similar requests, and support, comment, and share them on Facebook and Twitter.

3. Contact planner@brooklyncb6.org with any comments or concerns.
